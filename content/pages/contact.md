My name is Basiit and I am a backend engineer. I have been developing applications for around 3 years. Most of my experience lies in full-stack development scripting/scraping/automation and server administration. I have worked with Javascript/NodeJS C#, PHP,  Electron, Puppeteer, Selinum, React, Vue, Ember, and a little bit of Go and Python.
