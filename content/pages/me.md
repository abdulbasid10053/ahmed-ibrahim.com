My name is Muhamad Abdul Basid, at high scholl called me basiit take from middle name Abdul Basid. I’m a developer, designer, writer, and former chef from Purworejo, Central Java.

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while transitioning from designer to developer. I’ve continued throughout my career and the free resources I create help thousands of people successfully become developers.
